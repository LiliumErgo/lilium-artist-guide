## Minting/Buying NFT
- From Lilium home page, naviage to [`Buy`](https://www.liliumergo.io/buy)
    - Connect Wallet
    - Proxy Address is the same for all collections currently, this cannot be modified.
    - Singleton ID
        - Enter the id provided by the artist.
    - Buttons
        - These will be rendered once you enter a valid sale singleton token id.
        - There is a possibility of 5 buttons in total being displayed, but only those that correspond to the specific sale configurations you chose during the sale setup process.
        - The possible options will be the following:
            - Pay With Premint Token
                - Must be selected if the buyer wants to mint an NFT before the official public sale period begins.
                - The premint token id does not need to be manually input by the buyer.
                - The premint token must be in the connected wallet of the buyer.
                - Payment method must be selected:
                    - Pay With Custom Token, if applicable.
                    - Pay With ERG, if applicable.
                    - Use Pool, if applicable.
            - Pay With Whitelist Token
                - Must be selected if the buyer wants to mint an NFT for free after the sale period begins, or before if you have enabled Whitelist Bypass as an option in your sale configuration settings during the sale setup process.
                - The whitelist token id does not need to be manually input by the buyer.
                - The whitelist token must be in the connected wallet of the buyer.
                - Payment method must be selected:
                    - Pay With Custom Token cannot be selected (whitelist token implies free mint, i.e. not paying NFT price)
                    - Pay With ERG, will be selected automatically.
                    - Use Pool, if applicable.
                        - If using pool, then Pay With ERG will automatically be unselected since the sale liquidity pool will be paying for the Lilium sale fees.
            - Pay With Custom Token
                - Must be selected if the buyer wants to mint an NFT without paying for the NFT price in ERG.
                - Payment method must be selected:
                    - Pay With ERG, if the buyer is paying for the Lilium fees with their own ERG.
                    - Use Pool, if you will be paying for the Lilium sale fees instead of the buyer.
            - Pay With ERG
                - Selected if the buyer is paying the Lilium sale fees.
                - If the sale only accepts ERG, then this button will not be displayed.
            - Use Pool
                - Selected if the buyer is not paying for the Lilium sale fees, instead being paid for by you through the sale liquidity pool.
        - If Pay With Custom Token is not selected, the NFT price will be paid for in ERG.
        - Pay With ERG is associated with how the Lilium sale fees will be paid for and not the NFT itself.

## Implementing Minting/Buying NFT for Artist's Custom Frontend
This section is for the artist's frontend developers

See node js implementation in [here](/frontend-impl/frontend-payment.js)
- From the singleton ID
    - Query box by token id
        - The below can be hardcoded as well, lilium does this dynamically to support any singleton ids
        - Parse ergoTreeConstants (must use explorer api which supports this)
            - NFT Price
                - Index 29
            - Miner Fee
                - Index 38
            - Lilium Fee
                - Index 30
    - Call lilium api to get the dynamic tx operator Fee
    - Total fee is a sum of
        - Box Creation Fee (0.001 ERG)
        - Miner Fee x2
        - Lilium Fee
        - NFT Price
        - TX Operator Fee
    - Create a TX
        - Output Box must have
            - ReceiverErgoTree in R4
            - Singleton ID in R5
