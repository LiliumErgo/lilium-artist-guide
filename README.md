# Lilium Artist Docs
Documentation and KYA for the Lilium platform.

## KYA
1. Use at your own risk.
2. Contracts have not been audited by a third party.
3. Lilium is an on-demand NFT sales platform, this means that minting only occurs when the buyer decides to purchase an NFT. 
4. There is currently no content, intellectual property, or copyright license associated to the artwork being represented by the NFT and sold through the Lilium platform.
5. The sale is currently not randomized. To emulate this, please upload your metadata in a randomized order. The minting will only occur in the order that the metadata is uploaded.
6. We are not responsible for your life problems.
